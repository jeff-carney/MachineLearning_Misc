# MachineLearning_Misc

This repository contains a number of mini miscellaneous machine learning projects. Some logistic regression, softmax regression, gaussian discrimanant analysis, support vector machines, and random forrests. I hope I will have included all the relevant files to run any of these files with the exception of possibly the stacked svm-random forest one.
